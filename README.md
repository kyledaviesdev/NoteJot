# Overview

This is a project that was wrote in Kotlin. I wrote a note taking application which allows you to add, edit, view, display all notes, and delete notes.

My purpose for writing this was to show my skills in Kotlin and have a nice note taking app that I can use in the future.

In this I used Kotlin and txt files. Run the application and store the notes.

# Future Work

- Make a UI or APK out of it.
- Make it so you can edit the existing text of your previously created note.
- With the UI have it so you can organize the notes in a custom order.
